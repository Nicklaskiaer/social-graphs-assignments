# Formalia:

Please read the [assignment overview page](https://github.com/suneman/socialgraphs2025/wiki/Assignments) carefully before proceeding. This page contains information about formatting (including formats etc), group sizes, and many other aspects of handing in the assignment. 

_If you fail to follow these simple instructions, it will negatively impact your grade!_

**Due date and time**: The assignment is due on Tuesday September 30th, 2025 at 23:55. Hand in your IPython notebook file (with extension `.ipynb`) via DTU Learn

# Assignment 1.1: Exploring WS and BA models

This first part draws on the Watts-Stogatz and Barabasi-Albert models from Week 3. You should provide solutions to the exercises with the following titles from **Part 1** 

* *Did you really read the text? Answer the following questions (no calculations needed) in your IPython notebook*

* *WS edition*

And from **Part 2**

* *BA Edition*.
  * **Note**: The second part of this exercise (after the questions to the text) first has you build a BA network step-by-step, but doesn't ask any questions. For that part, I would simply like you to write well-documented code that shows how you build the network. 


# Assignment 1.2: Stats and visualization of the Rock Music Network

This second part requires you to have built the network of Rock Musicians as described in the exercises for Week 4. You should complete the following exercise from **Part 2**.

* *Explain your process in words*

* *Simple network statistics and analysis*.

  * **Note related to this and the following exercise**. It is nice to have the dataset underlying the statistics and visualization available when we grade. Therefore, I recommend that you create a small *network dataset*, which is simply your graph stored in some format that you like (since it's only a few hundred nodes and a few thousand edges, it won't take up a lot of space). You can then place that network one of your group members' GitHub account (or some other server that's available online) and have your Jupyter Notebook fetch that dataset when it runs. (It's OK to use an LLM for help with setting this up, if it seems difficult). 

And the following exercise from **Part 3**

* *Let's build a simple visualization of the network*

And that's it! You're all set.
