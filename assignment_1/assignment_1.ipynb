    "\n",
    "Section 3.5 decribes the idea of so called \"hubs\". Hubs represent a single node with an amount of links that drastically exceedes the average number of links. This is not represented in the Erdos random networks, but occurs often in the real world networks we examine. An example of a hub mentioned in the book is Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR), who was known to have above 22000 connections, with people he met in real life. This is wildly above the average person. And is not represented in the random network."
